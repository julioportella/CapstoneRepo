Team Charter
============

Purpose and goal.
-----------------

Exercise physiology is a challenging field. One of the key things for doctors
to understand is the interactions between the caused by the interaction among
three related systems: the respiratory system the cardiovascular system, and
the skeletal muscle system. This is currently done through Cardiopulmonary
exercise testing (CPET), which is visualized by looking at the slope of 9
different plots (known as the Wasserman 9 plot). Our stakeholders would like
us to use the data that they have collected to help develop a better
visualization of the Wasserman 9 plot. One that conveys the inner workings of
the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems so doctors can more
quickly and effectively diagnose patients.

Time commitment
---------------

For meetings and coordinations:
-   At least once a week a meeting with the client and the project manager
-   Team members will be responsive over Slack, WhatsApp, or Phone.
-   Primary Communication is through Slack, but the team will also have a
    weekly Zoom sync

The expected amount of time given for the project is proportional to the number
of credits of the Capstone
-   3 hours per week are given for each credit
-   4 credits mean at least 12 hours per week.
-   These 12 hours are a combination of individual work, research, coding,
    meetings, etc.

Team culture.
-------------
We plan to leverage each otherâ€™s strengths to get the job done. This means
delivering a great product to our stakeholder.

The team is mature enough to know when and where we can help and if someone else
needs to take lead. This will allow us to work in concert to deliver value to
our client and have a great capstone project.

Issues will be handled through our weekly sync meetings on Mondays, meetings
with stakeholders on Tuesdays, and regularly scheduled workdays on other days
of the week. By splitting roles and coordinating at least 2-3 times a week we
will be able to communicate our work status and avoid issues of duplication
and utilize delegation techniques to prevent simultaneous work issues from
occurring. Problems that arise will be dealt with in meetings that do not
include our clients, if any issue remains unresolved, we will bring issues to
our PM Heather.

As such, for team meetings we will consistently add tasks to our project board
(probably Trello) and update it every sync meeting on Mondays. To do this we
will have to add backlog, To Do, and update all Doing/Done items (though a
lot may be done individually throughout the week). On Mondays we will also
decide our agenda for the client meeting on Tuesdays and prepare any material
or questions/request we must take to the meeting to ensure meetings are
productive. Info requests for the client should be clear and concise in a
way that allows efficient removal of obstacles for the team

Therefore, our interactions with the clients should be straight-forward and
direct within the boundaries of cooperative interaction. We should always be as
prepared as possible to guarantee maximum productivity in our client meetings.
To create a more cooperative environment, we will also seek to be friendly and
create a sense of overall cooperation within the full stakeholder scenario.


Deliverables
------------
Our initial KPI is the interpretability/accuracy of our visualizations.

We need to receive the data and together with our PM establish a timeline.

Our process will be audited by ourselves and our PM as we establish goals and
more on a weekly meeting basis.


Desired end result
------------------

1.  Reachable goals: Our team will achieve is to finding a better way to
    presenting the data from the CPET Test. This will enable the clinician to
    make more precise diagnoses. Our Team will a new visualization for the
    test, showing the interaction between the three systems of interest
    (respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle), likely in the form of a
    composite vector for each.

2.  Tangible goals: Our team will create through their research.
    As described above, the product will be a 3D display clearly indicating
    which system dominates the test that causes termination of the test. Which
    will contribute to a grant being written involving Duke, University of
    California Irvine, Virginia Tech, and the University of Virginia.

3.  Outrageous goal: Would be developing a model that shows the systems impacts
    on each other. This algorithm that would permit athletes to better
    understand what systems they need to work on to improve their performance.
    It is possible we can add additional data and new types of data to enhance
    the understanding of the tri-systems relationships.

We will work on the deliverable with the client based on findings. First we
will work on an initial visualization, afterwards we will negotiate next steps
with the stakeholder.

Team members and roles
----------------------

### Derek Wales:

Model development and stakeholder communication. I want to help lift the team
toward success by helping my teammates. Primary point of contact with the client
for administrative tasks.

### Joao Mansur:

Agile manager, visualization specialist, also looking forward to the big-picture
aspects of modelling and ensuring that the product will please the client and be
truthfully useful. UX and presentation specialist.

### Julio Portella:

Software developer and healthcare informatics enthusiast. I am expected to do
the mathematical analysis and to work on the hard parts of the software
development process. On the other hand, I am expected to support my teammates in
the areas where they are more capable. Technical point of contact especially
regarding domain and CS knowledge.

Supporting resources
--------------------

At the moment we identified the additional resources

-   Duke University Faculty

-   Duke University Machine Learning Resources

-   Duke Center FOR Health Informatics

-   David Ward: Instructor in the Biomedical Engineering Department (BME 547).
    Consultation in software development using python

-   Take deep learning courses next semester: If doing the 3rd goal is possible,
    Deep Learning could be a very useful tool

Updates
-------

-   Weekly sync with stakeholders and our project manager and constant
    collaboration through GitLab and Slack

-   Start meetings with agendas and ending with action items

Links
-----

The project is important because it is an application of data science and
visualization that benefits two groups the doctors and the athletes.

-   Doctors: Currently CPET is hard to interpret. The project will make it
    easier for doctors to interpret the data, giving better diagnoses and
    understanding of their patients.

-   Athletes: If the third goal is reached, this could be very useful to improve
    the physical training for competitive athletes.
