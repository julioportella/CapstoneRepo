# Team Charter
## Purpose and goal.  

What do you want to accomplish this year? The specifics of the "what" can be a bit fluid as you adapt and better understand your project, but there should be a fix overarching goal.  You may need to revise this goal in the early stages and should work with your client and manager to create it.

## Time commitment.

For meetings and coordinations:
 * At least once a week a meeting with the client and the project manager
 * Give response as fast as possible
 * Most of the communication will be through Slack, but in some cases we will have one meeting at least once every two weeks.

The expected amount of time given for the project is proportional to the number of credits of the Capstone
 * 3 hours per week are given for each credit
 * 4 credits mean at least 12 hours per week.
 * These 12 hours are a combination of individual work, research, coding, meetings, etc.

## Team culture.

Your team culture is something that will largely emerge, rather than being prescribed, but there may be certain ideals you wish to aspire toward. For example, how you will make sure that opinion of every team-member is heard and considered? How do you want to resolve team conflicts? You may also want to think about attitudes you wish everyone has toward tasks, each other, clients, etc. A fun exercise to codify these ideals is to come up with a team motto.

## Deliverables

What are the performance indicators (sometimes called Key Performance Indicators) for your project?  What do you need to accomplish and when do you need to accomplish it by?  What indicators do you want to introduce to ensure you are making appropriate progress?  How are you going to audit your progress?

What is the remediation process if the project starts to slide?  How will you identify issues and what help will you plan to seek?

## Desired end result

How do you want to communicate your findings/products?  Do you want to write and submit an academic paper? Do you want to complete and advertise a public-facing document?  Write a codebase or API to pass on to the client?  Build a Dashboard for the client? Some combination? Work with your client and manager to establish how you want to deliver your findings/products/deliverables. It's ok if this fluctuates a bit at the beginning but you want to solidify the goal quickly.

## Team members and roles

#### List the team members and their roles.  Write out the expectations for each role in the project.

Team members:

### Derek Wales

### Joao Mansur

### Julio Portella:
Software developer and healthcare informatics enthusiast. I am expected to do the mathematical analysis and to work on the hard parts of the software development process. On the other hand, I am expected to support my teammates in the areas where they are more capable.


## Supporting resources

Your team is not operating in a vacuum.  Spend some time identifying additional resources and when they should be called on.  These resources can be used for technical help, figuring out team dynamics, or figuring out personal working habits/environments.

This document should formally state the team's commitment to utilizing these resources if and when issues arise.

## Reporting plan and meeting expectations

What are the team expectations for meetings, particularly with clients and managers? How is your team going to ensure that meetings are productive and clear? Should there be slides? Should the team make an outline of the progress before meetings?  Should the team write up meeting goals and agendas? 

As a note, one common pitfall with unproductive meetings is that you may race to gather results, but then not have any time to think about what they mean or what it is you want to (i) communicate to your client/manager or (ii) now that you have gotten these results what it is you need next.  If you realize your needs after your meeting you can create significant setbacks as you will have to wait for your next meeting to clear things up that could have been addressed with a bit more thought.
